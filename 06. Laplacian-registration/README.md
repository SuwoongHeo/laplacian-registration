# Deformation Transfer Matlab
The matlab implementation of Deformation transfer[1]. I had implemented this code by referring the c++ implementation code[2]. In order to run this code, please download the mesh data which can be found in project website[3]. If you have any question, please contact vereurer@gmail.com

- If you have problem with using parallel for loop(parfor), run below code in commandline
distcomp.feature( 'LocalUseMpiexec', false )
